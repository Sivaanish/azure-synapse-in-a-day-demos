## Exercise 7: Spark ML learning/inference and SQL pool load

Time required: 10 minutes

![The ML and SQL Pool portions of the diagram are highlighted.](media/diagram-ml-sql-pool.png "ML and SQL Pool load")

In addition to ETL processing, you can run machine learning workloads using Spark ML within a Spark Notebook. You can also use the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK from within a Spark Notebook in Synapse to perform automatic machine learning, a feature of Azure Machine Learning.

### Task 1: Import and execute notebook

Train and run machine learning models in a Spark pool and load the predicted results into a SQL pool.

1. Select the **Develop** hub.

4. Attach to **aiadspark** which you have created before. Run the notebook cells one by one to run SparkML and load the data into your SQL pool.

Click on **Next** in the below to proceed with the lab.
