## Exercise 1: Set up SQL pool access and create table

Time required: 10 minutes

![The SQL Pool portion of the diagram is highlighted.](media/diagram-sql-pool.png "SQL Pool")

A dedicated SQL Pool is one of the analytic runtimes in Azure Synapse Analytics that help you ingest, transform, model, and analyze your data. It offers T-SQL based compute and storage capabilities. With a dedicated SQL pool in your Synapse workspace, data can be loaded, modeled, processed, and delivered for faster analytic insight.

### Task 1: Allow pipelines to access SQL pools

Later in this lab, you will use the Automated Integration Runtime (IR) to copy data to the dedicated SQL pool within a data flow. But first, you must adjust the system assigned managed identity settings for your Synapse workspace to allow pipelines to access the pool.

1. Navigate to the Azure portal (<https://portal.azure.com>).

2. In the search menu, type **Synapse**, then select **Azure Synapse Analytics**.

    ![Synapse is highlighted in the search box, and the Azure Synapse Analytics workspace preview item in the results is highlighted.](media/search-synapse.png "Synapse search")

3. Select the Synapse Workspace that you created for this lab, or that was provided for you in the lab environment.

4. Select **Integration Settings** in the left-hand menu, check the box to **Allow pipelines (running as workspace's system assigned identity) to access SQL pools**, then select **Save**.

    ![The checkbox is checked.](media/synapse-allow-pipelines1.png "Managed identities")

### Task 2: Create table

1. Select **Overview** in the left-hand menu of the Synapse workspace, then select **Open** underneath **Open Synapse Studio** from the Synapse workspace page.

    ![Launch Synapse Studio is selected.](media/azure-synapse-launch-studio.png 'Launch Synapse Studio')

    After authenticating your account, you should see the Synapse Studio home page for your workspace.

    ![The home page for the workspace is displayed.](media/synapse-workspace-home.png "Synapse Studio home")

2. If you see the Getting started dialog, select **Close**.

    ![The close button is highlighted.](media/synapse-studio-getting-started.png "Getting started")

3. Select the **Develop** hub.

    ![The Develop hub is selected.](media/develop-hub.png "Develop hub")

4. Select **+**, then select **SQL script**.

    ![The new SQL script is selected.](media/new-sql-script.png "New SQL script")

5. Enter **Create DelaySummary** in the Name value within the Properties blade. Select the **aiaddw** dedicated SQL pool. Paste the script below into the script area, then select **Run**.

    ```sql
    --Set up Polybase
    CREATE MASTER KEY

    --Create destination table
    CREATE TABLE [dbo].[DelaySummary]
    ( 
        [Year] int NULL,
        [Month] int NULL,
        [DayofMonth] int NULL,
        [DayOfWeek] int NULL,
        [OriginAirportCode] [nvarchar](10)  NULL,
        [DepDelayCount] [bigint] NULL,
        [DepDelay15Count] [bigint] NULL,
        [AIRPORT_ID] [nvarchar](20) NULL,
        [AIRPORT] [nvarchar](100)  NULL,
        [DISPLAY_AIRPORT_NAME] [nvarchar](100) NULL,
        [LATITUDE] [nvarchar](20)  NULL,
        [LONGITUDE] [nvarchar](20)  NULL
    ) WITH
    (
        DISTRIBUTION = ROUND_ROBIN,
        CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX
    )
    GO
    ```

    ![The DelaySummary script is displayed.](media/delaysummary-script.png "New SQL script")

6. After you run the script, you should see a status that the script executed successfully.

    ![The script successfully completed.](media/delaysummary-script-successful.png "Query executed successfully")

7. Select **Publish all**, then select **Publish** in the dialog.

    ![Publish all is highlighted.](media/publish-all.png "Publish all")

    > â€»	For the remainder of the lab, select **Publish** as appropriate to save your work.

8. Select the **Data** hub.

    ![The data hub is selected.](media/data-hub.png "Data hub")

9. Select the **Workspace** tab, expand **SQL Databases**, expand the **aiaddw** SQL pool, and expand **Tables**. You will see the `DelaySummary` table. If it does not appear, select **Refresh**.
